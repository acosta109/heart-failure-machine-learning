# Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning
## Team: Anthony Costa, Jonathan Diaz, Sarah Kim, Aakash Nagalapura


# Overview of the Analysis
Our aim to produce a machine learning model that evaluates 11 factors to determine if someone has heart disease. 

* Age
* Sex
* ChestPainType
* Resting BP 
* Cholesterol
* FastingBS
* RestingECG
* MaxHR
* Exercise Angina
* Oldpeak
* ST_Slope
 
To get a general overview of our data:

* `Avg. Age = 53.5`
* `Avg. RestingBP = 132`
* `Avg. Cholesterol = 199`
* `Avg. MaxHR = 25.5`
* `Avg. Oldpeak = 0.887`
* `Avg. HeartDisease = 0.553`
